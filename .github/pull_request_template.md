## :white_check_mark: QA Handover checklist:

- [ ] The requirements are fulfilled by my solution. <!--- Do we have use cases or requirements for the area? They can usually be found here: Scenarios and Use Cases. Provide a link. If not, describe how has the specification been delivered? For RSF, a general “requirement” is often that it should work like the current Fass. Verify that all information/functionality from the current site is there - unless otherwise specified. -->
- [ ] All expected functionality is in place.
- [ ] Performance is acceptable. <!--- If not, why, and what needs to be done to improve it? Create and link JIRA issues if needed. -->
- [ ] Works in the dev environment. <!--- If not, why, and what needs to be done to make it run? Create and link JIRA issues if needed. -->
- [ ] The design is aligned with the Figma. <!--- As a starting point, enter the same information in the CMS as is seen in the figma designs, to make comparison easier -->
- [ ] The design is aligned for each screen size (usually; 375, 744, 1440 px and 1920px or greater).
<!--- Set your screen to the same resolution/size as the different sketches, starting with the smallest, and verify that the design is aligned for each size (usually; 375, 744, and 1440 px). -->
<!--- Open the design and your work on separate screens and set the same zoom level to make comparison easier -->
<!--- When done, increase the screen size to 1920px or greater and ensure that the design is still reasonable -->
