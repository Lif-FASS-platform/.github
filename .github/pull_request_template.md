### Testing
- [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes
- [ ] I have considered how my changes can affect other parts of the system, and tested those areas
- [ ] I've verified that my changes fulfill non-functional requirements like performance and accessibility

### Code Format and Style
- [ ] I've run Prettier lint
- [ ] I've addressed all suggestions from SonarQube
- [ ] I haven't left unnecessary logs or comments

### Maintainability
- [ ] Is the code easy to read and understand?
- [ ] Is the code not repeated (DRY Principle)?
- [ ] Is the code method/class structure good?

### Documentation
- [ ] I have updated related documentation if necessary

### Implementation
- [ ] Component has right architecture
- [ ] Is server side rendered if can be implemented without JavaScript usage
- [ ] Is client side rendered if can't be implemented without hooks or event listeners
- [ ] Page has right architecture
- [ ] Can be rendered as static site, If does not require runtime data (like request params etc) and JavaScript usage
- [ ] Responsiveness is made without JS usage - only via Tailwind usage or custom CSS implementation
- [ ] Client Components that handles logic via JavaScript cann't be replaced by solutions that not involves JS like redirection with Link instead of button or expanding section with details element instead of custom client component

### Best Practices
- [ ] I have proper error handling, especially if making requests to an external endpoint
- [ ] Important Errors and warnings are logged on an adequate logging level

### Architecture
- [ ] Is the separation of concerns-principle followed?
- [ ] Are all relevant parameters configurable and is the feature toggleable if necessary?
